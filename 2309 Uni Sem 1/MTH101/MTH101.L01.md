# What is symmetry?


We want to *quantify* the symmetry of *shapes*.

> [!definition] Symmetry groups 
> The **symmetry group** of a subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the subgroup $$ \mathrm{Sym}(S) := \left\{ T: \mathbb{R}^{n}\to \mathbb{R}^{n} \middle\vert \begin{align} Tx = Ox+b, O\in O(n), b\in \mathbb{R}^{n} \\ T(S) \subset S  \end{align} \right\}$$
> ![[MTH101.L01.Drawing 221007182040]]

When will two subsets have *same* symmetry group?

We want to say two shapes are *congruent* if they can be placed on top of one another by a rotation, a translation or a combination of such transformations.


> [!definition] Congruency of shapes
> Two subsets $S_{1},S_{2} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ are **congruent** if $$ T(S_{1})=S_{2} $$ where $Tx=Ox+b$ for $O\in O(n), b\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$.
