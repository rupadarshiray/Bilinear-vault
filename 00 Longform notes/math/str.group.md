# groups

> [!definition] group
> A **group** is a pair $G = (G,\star)$ consisting of a [[found.sets|set]] of elements $G$, and a [[found.sets.functions.binary|binary operation]] (which is **closed**) $$\star: G\times G \to G$$ such that:
> - the operation $\star$ is **associative** $$(a\star b)\star c = a \star (b\star c)\ \text{for any}\ a,b,c \in G$$
> - $G$ has an **identity element**, denoted $i_G$ with the property $$i_G \star g = g \star i_G = g \ \forall g \in G$$
> - each element $g \in G$ has an **inverse**, that is, an element $h \in G$ such that $$g \star h = h \star g = i_G$$
